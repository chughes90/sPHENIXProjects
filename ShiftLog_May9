AGS = Alternating Gradient Synchrotron

Wenesday May 17th is first collisions - commisioning starts

Beam-beam and zdc need to be up and running as before the shut of of racks
Engineers moving cables over the week

Shift Notes ~~~~~~
Restricted access need key card to open internal gate after plug door

Powered off the racks, alarms gone off but they are self-clearing

Racks are not back up yet... hopefully this evening

Detector operator computer shut down - need password to get in again after restart.

Reopening through vision client launcher instructions are not up-to-date. Comment is in the shift log for now. 
Password will be in the control room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HCal~~~~~~
Hanpu took cosmics last night, high voltage was seen to dip low in one channel which triggered yellow in monitoring. 
Take note if a channel goes low

One channel shows a half-high channel that needs cabling work

Replace the clock-master that was being repaired

Test-pulse board needs to be replaced

Data gets stuck on particular events - Martin P is working on that
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EMCAL~~~~~
Missing biasing channels- diconnected cables but there is a group that needs to be evaluated still
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TPC~~~~~~
Noise seems to have a new source of noise

Seems to be grouped around sector 01 and 11 --- %%R2 region is running around 98% channel efficieny if looking at the old plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ZDC~~~~~~
Need to be turned on now that they're unlocked
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
